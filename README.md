# Weapon Loadouts – Hades II Mod

This mod gives you the ability to setup arcana/keepsake/pinned boons loadouts for each weapons so you don't have to manually tinker those every time you use a different aspect.

![Aspect page](https://github.com/SMarechalBE/Hades-2-Weapon-Loadouts/raw/main/img/aspect_page.png)

Saving/Restoring a loadout is currently done through the aspect page:
- Saving loadout will take the following information:
  - equipped familiar
  - pinned boons
  - arcanas
  - saved keepsakes (see the mod dependency [Random Starting Keepsake](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Random_Starting_Keepsake/))
- Restoring will overwrite the informations above with the saved loadout.

At run start, a random keepsake will be picked from the saved ones. 

## WIP
Most features are implemented, though there may be some bugs lying around. It shouldn't do anything that could corrupt your save so don't worry. 

## Known bugs
Some information is not correctly updated or displayed to the user when restoring a loadout. Changing rooms usually doesn't change anything. Though it is only visual as starting a run will behave correctly.

## Planned features
- Showing saved loadout for each aspect instead of rotating model. With cycling button like TraitTray currently does.
- Dedicated buttons next to weapons in hub room, similar to pets.  

## Extra features
- Multiple loadouts for the same weapon/aspect, would then be randomly selected on run start or when restoring loadout.
