# Weapon Loadouts – Hades II Mod

This mod gives you the ability to setup arcana/keepsake/pinned boons loadouts for each weapons so you don't have to manually tinker those every time you use a different aspect.

## Motivation

In the vanilla game, nearly every time the aspect is changed, some tinkering must be done in the arcana page, a specific familiar may be used and a starting keepsake selected. It's not rare to realize the wrong starting keepsake, familiar or arcana page was picked after starting a run. Forcing to reload every time. 

This mod expand the arcana sets from the base game by giving the opportunity to the user to assign a loadout to each weapon aspects:
  - equipped familiar
  - pinned boons
  - arcanas
  - saved keepsakes (see the mod dependency [Random Starting Keepsake](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Random_Starting_Keepsake/))

## Behaviour changes

The main changes are happening inside the aspect pages: using usual left/right menu buttons, it is possible to cycle through 3 pages (arcanas, traits and default moving 3D model) displayed on the left side of the aspect screen. 

From this screen, it is then possible to save the current loadout for the selected aspect or simply to load the one already saved previously.
Then at run start, a random keepsake will be picked from [the saved ones](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Random_Starting_Keepsake/). 

## Setup
- This mod uses the mod loader [Hell2Modding](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/Hell2Modding/Hell2Modding/). 
- Go to the mod manager [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/ebkr/r2modman/) page and follow the installation procedure.
- Launch the game & Enjoy

## Configuration
Each weapon aspect has its entry in the `Loadout` section of the configuration page. 
It is possible to manually set values here, simply set the `Saved` value to true and add the needed traits/arcanas using in-game values.

## Future updates planned
- Dedicated buttons next to weapons in hub room for faster loading, similar to pets.  
- Setting arcanas directly from the aspect page

## Mod suggestions
Check out my others *QoL* mods, those are all cross-compatible and meant to be used together:
- [Improved Boon Info UI](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Improved_Boon_Info_UI/): improves boon information by adding a smart filtering system based on your currently picked boons.
- [Run Boon Overview](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Run_Boon_Overview/): aggregates all your currently available boons into Melinoë's Codex page.
- [Random Starting Keepsake](https://thunderstore.io/c/hades-ii/p/SMarBe/Random_Starting_Keepsake/): gives the possibility to set multiple keepsakes as favorite, a random one gets drawn when starting the run.
