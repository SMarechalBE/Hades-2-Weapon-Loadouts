# Weapon Loadouts – Hades II Mod

This mod gives you the ability to setup arcana/keepsake/pinned boons loadouts for each weapons so you don't have to manually tinker those every time you use a different aspect.

The data saved inside loadouts would consist of: 
- Arcana page
- Pinned boons
- Keepsake
- Pact of punishments

## Planned features
- Save/restore loadout behaviour.
- Dedicated buttons inside aspect page
- Dedicated buttons next to weapons in hub room, similar to pets.  

## Extra features
- Multiple loadouts for the same weapon/aspect, would then be randomly selected on run start or when restoring loadout.
